You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Friendzone is the ultimate place for meeting and making new friends. Friendzone is a free platform that allows you to connect and meet others through various different activities! Through the use of lobbies, it allows anyone in the area to join in on activities, setting a low pressure time, and activity for people to join in! Through the use of online chats as well, users can coordinate and go above and beyond what the base lobby system offers, bringing people together!

### Design
#### Login Page
![Login Page Sketch](ProfilePageWebDevelopment.jpg)

This will be the main landing page. From here this is how users sign up for an account, or if already users, sign in! We will have options to sign in with google or outlook by using OAuth, allowing more options for users to sign up with. 

#### Lobby Select Page
![Lobby Discovery Page Sketch](LobbySelectWebDevelopment.jpg)

This will the main sign in page where users can sign up and find activities to do with others! From here lobbies will popup in individual cards where you can see light details about them, and you can have the options to filter through to find events relavant to you. You can join and view in depth activites from this page. 

#### Lobby Detail Page
![Lobby Detail Sketch](LobbyDetailWebDevelopment.jpg)

This is the in depth page where you can view specific event details including but not limited to: Event name, description, location, time, members attending. From here you can also chat with others attending to pre arrange if needed and to get to know people before you show up!

#### Profile Page

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - This will be the skeleton of the website, this is the technology that holds what words are displayed and what content is displayed on each page.
- **CSS** - CSS is used for styling the page! CSS will allow me to create an aesthetically pleasing website, attracting users to our website and helping them stay with frictionless experience.
- **React** - React is a tool that helps me as a developer create the website faster. It comes with features that allow me to style and use individual components of one portion of the website, in others, speeding up development time and helping keep the frontend organized. React will also allow the users to navigate around the website, getting from one page to another.  
- **Service** - This is the component of our website that makes it work! Through the use of oAuth I can allow users the flexibility of logging in with different accounts, such as with a google account, while still being able to customize their experience while on my website. This is also what serves content, bridging the gap between things such as what users see and what is stored, and what other users may contribute to the website! For my website specifically there will be dynamically created routes for each of the different lobbies, there will be individual profile website routes, and routes that allow users to login and authenticate themselves. 
- **DB/Login** - This is where we will store user information. This is what allows the website to save information about users, such as their name, their chat history, their preferences, any and all information is stored in the database. With logins it allows us to create a more custom and personalized experience for each user, and what seperates one person between another. It will function primarily as an idenifier, with the option to creating a recomendation system to keep users engaged and serve them content that is tuned to what they want to go do. 
- **WebSocket** - Online chats and finding activities will be a major part of this website, and through the use of WebSockets it allows the website to communicate live information directly to the user in real time. Within the world of chats this prevents the need to refresh the page to see if new messages were sent, it allows us to update the status of lobbies in real time, and allows users to see if others are online in real time!
